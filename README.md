#Getting Started
###2016/17 Team will probably want to update this section.
  1. Install Visual Studio 2015 (Community Edition is free)
  2. Download or build wxWidgets 2.8.12 binaries for Windows with openGL enabled.
  3. Set Windows environment variables (assuming you install the binaries to `C:\`, if not adjust accordingly)
    * `WXADDITIONS = C:\wxWidgets-2.8.12\additions`
    * `WXWIN = C:\wxWidgets-2.8.12`
  4. Clone this repository and open the solution file with Visual Studio.
